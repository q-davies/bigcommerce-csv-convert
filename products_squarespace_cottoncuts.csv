I've been taking my game to guilds with hand-written dice and having a lot of fun. Each time we play, the group says ""You should really market this..."" and now I AM! Trader's Dice is a game that you can play with three or more people -- the more the merrier. Roll the dice, trade to the left, trade to the right, trade across the table, or steal from the kitty. You can trade anything: fat quarters, charm squares, jelly roll strips, patterns, thread, you name it. And you don't have to be a quilter to play.

Add to that miscuts and we end up with a lot of scrap fabric perfectly paired to a scrap quilter.  Each grab bag is a potpourri - strips range from 12-21"" long and about 2"" wide (sometimes ranging from 1"" - 4"" in width) - with lots of random shapes and cuts perfect for the scrap enthusiast.  For reference, a yard of linear fabric is approximately 6 oz, so each bag would be approximately a little more than 2 yards if continuous off the bolt.<br><br>You may add to the notes if you'd like a specific colorway, but we cannot guarantee scraps from that colorway as our bags are limited.<br><br>Please note - the cost includes shipping and is intended to cover the cost of shipping and transaction fees through Etsy.
