I've been taking my game to guilds with hand-written dice and having a lot of fun. Each time we play, the group says 'You should really market this...' and now I AM! Trader's Dice is a game that you can play with three or more people -- the more the merrier. Roll the dice, trade to the left, trade to the right, trade across the table, or steal from the kitty. You can trade anything: fat quarters, charm squares, jelly roll strips, patterns, thread, you name it. And you don't have to be a quilter to play.
